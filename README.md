# Notifiers

Scripts for showing OSX notifications or dialogs.

- crontab 
- AppleScript
- python

### Usage of the osascript command

These scripts basically build a valid osascript cli command for notifications or dialogs in Mac OSX.

### Future Enhancements and Ideas
- Linux version
- A dialog that takes a time and a reminder that could be triggered with a system keyboard shortcut
